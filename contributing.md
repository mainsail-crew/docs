# Contributing

Pull requests and documentation updates are always welcome! Here are some guidelines for how to contribute:

* Find an issue that you are interested in improving or a feature that you would like to add.
* In GitHub, fork the repository by clicking the `Fork` button in the upper right hand of the project's Github page.
* Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git`.
* Create a new branch for your fix using git checkout -b branch-name-here.
* Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.
* Use `git add insert-paths-of-changed-files-here` to add the file contents of the changed files to git.
* Use `git commit` and on the first line `"Insert a short message of the changes made here"` to add a descriptive
* message. Insert a line break and on the third line sign off on your commit with your name and email
* address: `Signed-off-by: Your Name <your-email-address>`.
* Push the changes to your remote repository using `git push origin branch-name-here`.
* Visit the Mainsail repository and click the `Pull requests` tab.  Click `New pull request`.
* Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated
with your change. For example, you can title an issue like so "Added more log outputting to resolve #4352".
* In the description of the pull request, explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the
pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainer.
* Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.  The reviewer may ask for changes before merging.
