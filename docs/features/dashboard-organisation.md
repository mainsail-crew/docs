# Dashboard Organisation

There are several ways to customize your dashboard.

## Rearrange panels and show/hide them

The panels on the dashboard can be rearranged. How to do this is described in the [Dashboard Settings page](/overview/settings/dashboard).

Please note that settings can be customized for each device class, such as desktop or mobile. Each class supports different column layouts, allowing you to display, hide, or reorder panels independently—for example, showing certain panels on desktop while hiding them on mobile.

## Collapsible panels

Dashboard panels can be collapsed to temporarily save space and expanded again when needed. Mainsail will remember your last layout, restoring it automatically on your next visit.

## Macro Management

The dashboard layout can be further customized through Mainsail’s macro management system. In **Expert Mode**, you can create macro groups fthat appear as separate panels on the dashboard. You can fully customize the macro colors and control their visibility based on the printer’s current status.
