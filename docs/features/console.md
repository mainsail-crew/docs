# Console

The console is your direct interface to communicate with Klipper. Send G-code commands, execute macros, and view
responses in real-time. With features like auto-complete, a built-in command reference, and customizable output filters,
the console helps you interact with your printer efficiently. Access it from the dashboard panel or the dedicated
console page in the sidebar.

## Send commands

Start typing your command in the console input field. To submit, press Enter or click the paper airplane icon.

Use the `TAB` key to auto-complete commands. If multiple options are available, a list will appear—click on a command to
select it, or continue typing and press `TAB` again to refine the suggestion.

On touchscreen devices, a double-arrow icon appears next to the input field. Tap it to trigger auto-complete—this
replaces the `TAB` key functionality, which is not available without a physical keyboard.

filters in the **Settings**.
