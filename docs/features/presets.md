# Presets

Presets allow you to save temperature settings and G-Code commands for quick access. Use them
for preheating your printer with filament-specific temperatures, cooling down after a print,
or executing custom G-Code sequences with a single click.

## Features

- **Preheat**: Set temperatures for extruder, heated bed, and other heaters
- **Cooldown**: Quickly turn off all heaters with a single click
- **Custom G-Code**: Execute additional commands after setting temperatures
- **Multiple Presets**: Create different presets for various filament types or workflows

For detailed configuration, see the [Presets Settings](../settings/presets.md) page.
