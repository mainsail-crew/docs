# Localization

Mainsail is available in many different languages, translated by the community. You can easily
switch between languages in the interface settings.

## Select Language

To change the language, open the **Interface Settings** by clicking the **cogs icon** in the
top-right corner.

![Open Settings Menu](../images/features/localization-settings-menu.avif)

In the **General (1)** section, select your preferred language from the dropdown (2).

## Contributing Translations

Missing a translation or found an incorrect one? You are welcome to help improve Mainsail's
translations. See the [Localization Guide](../development/localization.md) for instructions on
how to contribute.
