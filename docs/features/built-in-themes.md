# Built-in Themes

Built-in themes are pre-designed themes that provide a quick and easy way to customize the look
and feel of Mainsail without creating a design from scratch.

Mainsail includes themes from two groups:

- **Open-Source Communities**: Themes from large open-source 3D printing projects
- **Vendor Sponsors**: Exclusive themes as recognition for their support

!!! tip "Want a Built-in Theme?"
    If you are a maintainer of a large open-source 3D printing project, contact the Mainsail
    crew on [Discord](https://discord.gg/mainsail){:target="_blank"} to request a built-in theme.

## Change Theme

To change the theme in Mainsail:

1. Open the **Interface Settings** by clicking the **cogs icon** in the top-right corner
