# Data Privacy

Mainsail understands the need for data privacy, and it has been designed to only run in your browser locally.

The following table applies to Mainsail when installed locally or accessed remotely at
[my.mainsail.xyz](https://my.mainsail.xyz){:target="_blank"}.

| Feature                                                      | Status |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------|:------:|
| Store static files in browser storage (.html, .js, .css)     |   ✅    |
| Communicate directly with your printer via the Moonraker API |   ✅    |
| Telemetry                                                    |   ❌    |
| Send or transfer any data externally                         |   ❌    |

## Will my data be safe if I use the hosted version?

Accessing [my.mainsail.xyz](https://my.mainsail.xyz){:target="_blank"} stores the .html, .js and .css files for
Mainsail locally in your browser's storage in exactly the same way that an instance running on your local hardware
would do. There is no functional difference or concerns between accessing Mainsail locally or in a remotely public
hosted instance.

Running Mainsail both locally and remotely in parallel is also possible.

## Third party software

Mainsail does not modify any third party packages and does not control data privacy for any third party packages you
choose to install.
