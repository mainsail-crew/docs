# GitHub Discussions

[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/mainsail-crew/discussions){:target="_blank"} is our second official
support platform. If you don't have a Discord account or prefer GitHub, this is the right place for you.

## How to use GitHub Discussions

Open a new discussion in the **Help** category and describe your issue. Please include a clear title so others can
quickly understand what your problem is about.

## When your issue is resolved

If your problem has been solved, please **mark the answer** or **close the discussion**. This helps keep the area clean
and makes it easier for others to find solutions to similar problems.

## Open a discussion

If you have read through the [general guidelines](index.md), you are ready to start your first post.
