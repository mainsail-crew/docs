# Getting Help

We provide support for all Mainsail-Crew software on the following platforms:

- [:fontawesome-brands-discord: Discord](discord.md) — Our primary community support platform
- [:fontawesome-brands-github: GitHub Discussions](github-discussions.md) — Alternative support via GitHub
- [:fontawesome-brands-reddit: Reddit](reddit.md) — Community-driven help (not officially supported by the
  Mainsail-Crew)

!!! note "We are volunteers"
    The entire Mainsail-Crew works on this project in their **free time**. Most of us are based in **Europe (EU)**, so
    depending on your time zone, it may take a little longer before you receive a response. We appreciate your patience
    and understanding!

## Before you ask

To help us help you as quickly as possible, please keep the following general guidelines in mind, no matter which
platform you choose.

### Is your issue part of the Mainsail universe?

We support all software developed by the Mainsail-Crew, as well as closely related projects like Klipper and
Moonraker. Questions about third-party programs or macros should be directed to the respective project's repository
or community.

### Provide as much information as possible

Always include **logs** and/or **screenshots** related to your issue. Describe in detail when the problem occurred and
what you have already tried to fix it. There is no such thing as too much information.

!!! tip
    Configuration problems or errors from your printer usually have nothing to do with Mainsail itself. Mainsail is
    just the messenger showing you the problem — don't shoot the messenger!

### Be patient and polite

Everyone providing support, whether part of the crew or a community member, is doing this **voluntarily and unpaid**.
Please be polite and patient, and follow the instructions you are given.

!!! warning
    Don't ask in multiple places at the same time. Getting help on multiple platforms for the same problem makes it
    more difficult and time-consuming for everyone involved.
