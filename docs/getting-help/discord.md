# Discord

Our [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/mainsail){:target="_blank"} is the primary platform for getting help with
Mainsail and related software. We are glad to help and chat with you, but to get the best support possible, please
follow a few simple rules.

## Use the support forum — not the chat

The chat area of the Mainsail Discord is for **chatting only**. If you need help with a problem, open a post inside the
**support-forum** channel. Don't hesitate to open a post even for small problems.

## Choose a good post name and the correct tag

A clear post title and the right tag make it much easier for others to understand your issue. Please choose **only one
tag** that best fits your problem:

| Tag            | When to use                                                                                                |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mainsail**   | Issues with the web interface itself.                                                                      |
| **Klipper**    | Printer-related problems, errors shown in the UI, or `printer.cfg` questions. This is the most common tag. |
| **Moonraker**  | Issues with updates, authorization, or message forwarding between Klipper and Mainsail.                    |
| **Linux**      | General Linux questions, SSH errors, or OS-level issues.                                                   |
| **MainsailOS** | Questions specific to the MainsailOS image (not general Linux or Klipper issues).                          |
| **Webcam**     | Webcam setup, streaming issues, or Crowsnest questions.                                                    |
| **Timelapse**  | Setup or configuration of Moonraker-Timelapse.                                                             |

!!! tip
    Configuration problems or errors from your printer usually have nothing to do with Mainsail itself. Mainsail is
    just the messenger showing you the problem. Don't shoot the messenger! In most cases, the **Klipper** tag is the
    right choice.

## When your issue is resolved

If your problem has been solved, please **close your post** again. This helps keep the support forum clean and makes it
easier for others to find open issues. More information about this can be found in the README post in the Support-Forum
on Discord.
