# Crowsnest

> A crow's nest is a structure in the upper part of the main mast of a ship or a structure that is used as a lookout point. [_Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow's\_nest)

Crowsnest is a webcam daemon for Raspberry Pi OS distributions like MainsailOS. The service got its name from the crow's nest of a sailing ship. Its purpose is to easily keep an eye on the 3D printer from a distance.

    We are **only actively testing on Raspberry Pi OS/MainsailOS**. If you test it on other distributions, feel free to create a pull request for the readme, or contact us on Discord.
