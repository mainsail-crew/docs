# Sample config

During the installation of Crowsnest, a sample configuration file named `crowsnest.conf` is created in the `printer_data/config` folder. In Mainsail, you can edit this file in the config section.

Crowsnest will start automatically with the settings specified in the configuration file if a camera is attached.

You can view the template [here](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/crowsnest/blob/master/resources/crowsnest.conf).
