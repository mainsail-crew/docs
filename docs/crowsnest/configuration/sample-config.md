# Sample config

Crowsnest installation creates a `crowsnest.conf` sample in `printer_data/config`. In Mainsail, you can edit this file in the config section.

Crowsnest will start automatically with the settings specified in the configuration file if a camera is attached.

You can view the template [here](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/crowsnest/blob/master/resources/crowsnest.conf).
