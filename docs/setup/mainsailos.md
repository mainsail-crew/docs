# MainsailOS

The easiest and quickest way to get started is by using the pre-built MainsailOS image. MainsailOS is a ready-to-use
operating system image that includes Mainsail, Moonraker, Klipper, and all necessary dependencies. Simply flash the
image onto an SD card, insert it into your SBC (like a Raspberry Pi), and you're ready to go. This method is ideal for
most users and offers a straightforward setup process.
