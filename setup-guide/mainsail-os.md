# Installing MainsailOS

MainsailOS builds upon Raspberry Pi OS Lite by including Klipper, Moonraker, and Mainsail in the disc image, making setup quick and Mainsail easier to use with Klipper and Moonraker. 

For more advanced users, Mainsail can be  [manually installed](manual-setup/index.md) for more complex and custom configurations.

If you are familiar with the process to flash the firmware, please use your preferred method as you normally would. 

If you are unfamiliar with the flashing process we have documented two methods to flash MainsailOS to your SD card:

* [Raspberry Pi Imager](mainsailos/pi-imager) (cross-platform, easiest) <span class="label label-red">recommended</span>  
* [balenaEtcher](mainsailos/balena-etcher) (requires manual setup)
