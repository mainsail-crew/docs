# Installing Mainsail using Docker

It's possible to run Mainsail in Docker with our pre-built images. These images are running NGINX with Mainsail.
Our images are hosted on the Github Package Registry. You can find more details [here](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/mainsail/pkgs/container/mainsail).

The image can be pulled using:

```sh
$ docker pull ghcr.io/mainsail-crew/mainsail
```

## Configuration for the Docker image
By default the image will connect to `localhost:7125`. If Moonraker is not running on that address, you can configure Mainsail to behave differently using a config file. You can mount this file in your container.

First make sure that you have a `config.json` file configured. This is a `json` file that can look like this:

```json
{
  "remoteMode": true
}
```

You can set Mainsail in remote mode using the `remoteMode` option. That way you can manage your printers in the UI.

## Running with the custom configuration

After creating the `config.json` file the container is ready to run. Make sure you're executing the command in the same directory as your `config.json`.
Running the following command will launch Mainsail on `http://localhost:8080`:

```sh
$ docker run \
  --name mainsail \
  -v "$(pwd)/config.json:/usr/share/nginx/html/config.json" \
  -p "8080:80" \
  ghcr.io/mainsail-crew/mainsail 
```

### Specifically for Windows, you can run:
```sh
docker run --name mainsail -v "%cd%//config.json:/usr/share/nginx/html/config.json" -p "8080:80" ghcr.io/mainsail-crew/mainsail 
```

## Updating the container

`docker run` will always run the image that's locally available. 
To get the latest image locally available, you'll just need to pull the image again. 
After that, the `docker run` command will use the newest version.
